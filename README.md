### Hi! I'm Hudson HeadleyðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m a Protocol Engineer passionate about decentralization, worker ownership, and governance design. 

Iâ€™ve been involved with developing many DAOs with various models and is currently developing Poa, a no-code DAO builder geared towards orgs that are fully owned by the community and not by capital. 

In all my work, I hope to build spaces for founders interested in community ownership to experiment and innovate quickly with new governance models.

## Current Projects:

### Perpetual Organization Architect (Poa) and Perpetual Organization Protocol

First Place Winner of Best New Subgraph (The Graph) at ETHDenver [here.](https://ethereumdenver.medium.com/ethdenver-2024-buidlathon-track-sponsor-bounty-winners-1960eea4d0ae)

Participated in Gitcoin Grants Round 20 [here.](https://explorer.gitcoin.co/#/round/42161/23/50)

Grant Winner from MOROS NET [here.](https://morosnet.com/project/poa-perpetual-organization-architect/)

**Perpetual Organizations (POs)** are fully worker-owned, unstoppable DAO. Unlike traditional DAOs, POs donâ€™t allow members to buy tokens. Instead, members earn tokens by contributing or are granted direct democracy tokens by joining as a community member. You can learn more about these models and hybrid voting [here.](https://poa.community/docs/hybridVoting/)

**The Perpetual Organization Protocol** is a set of smart contracts that allows a user to deploy a custom Perpetual Organization that is automatically indexed by the subgraph. 

**The Perpetual Organization Architect** is a no-code AI tool built on top of the protocol that helps users define the features they want in their Perpetual Organization and deploys the PO for them.

The current version (AlphaV3) guides the user through decisions like role distribution, governance, and voting design. Based on the user's selections, it deploys a customized Perpetual Organization that is fully decentralized in nature.

My Role:
I created 90% of the front end, which is currently still under construction. This included the system design, subgraph development, smart contract development, governance design. I will continue to work on the project longterm. Checkout the smart contracts and subgraph!

### IDI Volunteer Network
A community hub for assigning tasks and designing on projects and goals for the Inclusive Design Instituteâ€™s volunteer network

My Role:
I am the Lead DAO Designer and Developer. I've developed the smart contract protocol and tech stack. Currently waiting on front end designs.

### KUBI DAO 
A DAO and task manager for the University of Kansas Blockchain Institute with innovative participation based voting system (Project Pinned)

My Role:
I've been the lead designer and developer of this project (99% of contribution) building the smart contracts, subgraph, and front end from scratch. Put hundreds of hours into this focusing on making as decentralized as possible while innovating in the governance design

### AttendThis  
A blockchain based attendance reward system to redeem attendance for coupons at local businesses. Built to protect user privacy but still verify attendance. App and website. (Pinned Project)

My Role: 
I designed the decentralized tech stack and smart contract protocol and have mainly been working on developing the subgraph and connecting everything to the front end.

Typescript
Next.js
Solidity
GraphQL
C++
Python

## Other Projects and Research:

**Research Paper** (Fall 2022): 
The Spectrum of Distributed Decision Making (DDM) and its Effects on Innovation, Worker Satisfaction, and Organizational Efficiency:
Completed independent study class mentored by Professor Armin Schulz analyzing the spectrum of DDM from centralized to perfectly decentralized looking at the empirical and theoretical impacts of different DDM models.

**DAO Tools** (Spring 2023):
Used Chainlink functions beta to create a GPT-3 based task reviewer

**AI DAO Alignment** (Summer 2023):
Designed a DAO system in collaboration with the IDI that finds regional consensus on issues surrounding AI bias. Failed to get OpenAI grant

**Hack Midwest 2023** (Fall 2023):
Used ERC-6551 standard to make a platform for creating donation NFTs that will send money back automatically if goal isn't met

## Volunteering and Teaching Experience:

**University of Kansas Blockchain Institute** (2024):
- After serving as the 2023 VP of Engineering, I have remained connected with the community as an advisor.
- I help teach classes as a guest speaker, help maintain the DAO, and support students in their growth as young blockchain developers

**Kansas Blockchain Fellowship** (Summer 2024):
- I mentored 16 students over the summer as they built their capstone projects and judged the projects in the final hackathon submission.
- I taught two classes: Applications of Blockchain and Overview of Industry, where I introduced students to real world applications of blockchain. I also assisted a dApp Development Workshop.
